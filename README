getmeson.py
===========

description
-----------
A python script that downloads a release of meson to ./meson and checks its
hash. Use it in your projects if you don't want to require users to
`pip install meson`. Is compatible with python 3.5 and up.

options
-------
`-n` signals a dry run (print what is going to be downloaded).

exit status
-----------
Exit code of 0 is good, it means you already have meson or the download was
successful. Exit code of 1 means that something went wrong.

bugs
----
If getmeson.py errors, it won't clean up after itself, i.e., there may be a
`meson/` or `meson-{VERSION}/` directory left over.
